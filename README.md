<h2>Abstract: </h2>

<p> This research explores the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and machine learning to extract actionable insights from team survey data and software repository metrics. By analyzing survey responses that assess conflict levels, collaboration, and commitment alongside repository activity metrics—such as commit frequency, issue tracking, and code review participation—we classify teams into high-performing, struggling, isolated, or balanced groups using clustering techniques. Additionally, machine learning models are employed to identify key patterns that influence team success and provide data-driven recommendations for improving collaboration and productivity.
</p>

<p>To enhance insight extraction, we evaluate the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analyzing qualitative team feedback. By comparing different LLMs, we assess their effectiveness in identifying trends, summarizing unstructured responses, and generating actionable recommendations. This complements our performance analysis by automating the interpretation of team dynamics, allowing for more scalable and efficient assessments of team strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, we extend our approach to open-source software (OSS) repositories, comparing academic teams with industry-like OSS teams to identify key differences in collaboration styles and uncover skill gaps that can help better prepare students for careers in software development.</p>
<p>Through RAG-powered analysis, we bridge the gap between qualitative team feedback and quantitative development metrics, making insights more accessible and actionable. The findings from this research will provide practical recommendations for team restructuring, improving collaboration strategies, and enhancing workforce readiness. By integrating machine learning, LLMs, and OSS comparisons, this study offers valuable insights for engineering managers, educators, and organizations aiming to optimize team performance and strengthen long-term software development success.
