<h1>GitDash: A Data-Driven Dashboard for Monitoring Team Progress in Software Engineering Education</h1>

<h2>Abstract: </h2>

<p> GitDash, a data-informed dashboard designed to visualize and assess student engagement in software engineering team
projects. By synthesizing GitHub activity data and peer evaluation scores, GitDash provides instructors with an integrated platform to explore contribution patterns, detect imbalances in participation, and interpret team dynamics across collaboration, commitment, and conflict.
The system employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to classify teams into behavioral archetypes, enhancing interpretability and enabling targeted instructional support. Through interactive panels focusing on weekly activity, team trends, and individual member insights GitDash facilitates real-time monitoring and supports equitable, evidence-based assessment practices. The tool demonstrates how combining behavioral and perceptual data can inform pedagogy and foster more transparent evaluation in collaborative software education.d
